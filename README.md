# learning-android

This repository consists of all my code developed while learning Android Concepts like Activity, LifeCycle, Permissions, Fragments, Menus, Data sharing across activities, Layouts, Toast, ActionBar, Buttons, etc.  I also developed a 'Personal Task Management' based app using all the above concepts and few other features.
